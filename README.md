# SYND_Patch!

Synd_Patch project aims at solving various real-time problems faced by the customers and bank
staff on a daily basis by using combinations of latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence,
IOT and Geo-mapping. Some of the problems identified were the issues with cleanliness, manual
form-filling and crowd-management. With this project, people will be able to connect with the
bank managers and make sure all their issues and problems are rectified and solved as soon as
possible. This will also help in reducing human error and further build customer loyalty and
speed up the process.

## SyndPatch Modules:

### Mark a zone : 
We believe that its every citizens responsibility that they need to keep the surroundings clean. Keeping that in mind, we have come up with this module called “Mark a Zone” wherein any customer or staff members who are inside the bank can notify the uncleaned sections around them. The flow of the app works in a way wherein user can click a picture, give a title and some description to it, selecting the area(department) and posting it. This query will then be notified to all the cleaners and manager of that bank and hence keep the ambience presentable. Adding to it, the fake users not in or around the bank won't be able to mess up with feature since while posting the query, the app will take the user’s GPS location and check if the coordinates meet the bank’s location coordinates. Also the user cannot upload an image from their gallery, keeping it fake proof.
Queue Management : Many of the times, we are unaware of the crowd in the bank and hence a lot of time is wasted. Keeping this problem in mind, we have come an activity that takes real time count of the crowd with the help of the CCTvs in the bank and notifies the user accordingly.

### Premium Holders : 
This module is internally connected to the mark a zone and  suggestions module. The more number of problems that you identified for the bank, the more chances of you being the premium holder increases. Points are being awarded on every zone that you identify and suggestions that you pitch and are supported by the fellow members of the app. This rewards can give an advancement in following ways: 
Becoming a premium holders.
- Book a slot from any place.
- Special Treatment. 

### AutoGeneration : 
Since banks already has the personal data of the account holders, filing the forms and slips for the same data causes redundancy of data and efforts. Targeting this problem, this activity will allow to fetch data from our centralized database and automatically fill the forms as and when required by the account holders. Pre-defined templates will be filled and will be mailed to the printing machine to get and submit its hardcopies if required.

### Maps : 
This activity is for the cleaners of the bank wherein they will get the exact details of the problem pitched by the users. Using geo tagging technology, we will be providing the exact coordinates and the directions to branch problem. Also a brief description and solution along with an image will be displayed for getting more information for that query. 

### SOS :
The users can notify about their presence and using geofence technology we can understand if they are inside a specific radius of the bank.

### Suggestions : 
Any user connected to the bank anyway can drop his suggestions and problems in this forum. This allows the other participants to upvote or downvote and give solutions according to their experience and knowledge.This will help in the overall development of the bank.

### Summary : 
SyndPatch project consists of various modules patched together into the existing application. It focuses on various real time problems faced by bank users and tries and solves them in the best possible way. A platform that gives access to scattered and sporadically distributed information about various problems related to the bank services. A classified system that builds a bridge between root source of waste and daily customers and bank staff for retreating or reusing of waste and cleaning dirty/stinky areas in a sustainable manner.
