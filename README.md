# SYND

Synd_Patch project aims at solving various real-time problems faced by the customers and bank
staff on a daily basis by using combinations of latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence,
IOT and Geo-mapping. Some of the problems identified were the issues with cleanliness, manual
form-filling and crowd-management. With this project, people will be able to connect with the
bank managers and make sure all their issues and problems are rectified and solved as soon as
possible. This will also help in reducing human error and further build customer loyalty and
speed up the process.
